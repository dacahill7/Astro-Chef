The Kitchen: The True Final Frontier!



This project was developed for Purdue University's BoilerMake Hackathon. Gina Clepper, Jacob Miecznikowski, Adam Chesak, and Daniel Cahill all collaborated on this. The title is Astro-Chef to  fit the space theme.
Due to Git issues, some merges were done by hand, resulting in multiple repositories and commits not properly contributed to the correct programmer.





This application concept was originally created by Daniel Cahill. 
As a result of the quick pace and learning focus of the hackathon, there were several issues with the project and the text recognition wasn't as good as it could be. Daniel remains committed to the concept and will be creating a new app under a new name. This will be linked here when it is created.
